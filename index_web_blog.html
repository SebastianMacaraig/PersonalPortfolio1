<h2 id = "Q1"><span>What is</span> Onmyoji<span>?</span></h2>
<div>
    <p id = "what"align = "center">  Onmyoji is a Turn Base Role playing game Offered by NetEase Games and was released last Jan 3, 2018, this game is a turn-based fantasy strategy game with PVP or PVE battles, where you can strengthen your beloved shikigami to build your dream tactical team and defeat various demons to become the ultimate onmyoji.</p>

    <p id = "playing" align = "center">I've been playing ONMYOJI together with my siblings for quite a while now, and I must say we really love it to the point that we even established a guild of our own in the game. It's like a kind of bonding for us especially when we fight assembly bosses and hunt Kirin bosses together as a team. and a factor that's really appealing to this game is the fact that there are NO TOXIC PLAYERS at all, the onmyoji community is mainly composed of kind and helpful individuals from all over the world. In this game, you play mainly as Seimei and battle against many different shikigami when following the main storyline. To test your and your shikigamis' strength you can challenge through DUEL other players all over the world. Playing this game during the ongoing pandemic really takes my mind off all the anxiety that's been building up from not getting to go outside, being deprived of socialization from my friends, and academic stress. In this page i will provide you with some basic knowledge and insights about the gameplay and also my current team composition. I hope you'll find this game as fun and stress-relieving as it is for me.</p>
